Experiments for superresolution using Yang's approach. 

superres_joint.m : learns two sets of dictionaries from a pair of fullsize - downsized image. 

Results: Reasonable sharpening of features. 
	Edges in the lower res dictionaries had very short edges for some reason. 
	Short edges are also present when learning few dictionaries with low lambda.(Maybe there's a 		
	connection somewhere!)
	Work discontinued due to effort in graphs.
