Learn Dictionaries without lowass filter using addtional regularizers:

|\nabla x|^2

|\nabla D|^2

|\nabla D*x|^2 


Results: 

It works in the sense that the "high frequency" patches look similiar to regular cbpdn dictionaries. Discontinued due to Erik's work. 

Seems that larger patches, taking bigger stepsizes, and adding gradient penalties, or simply adding a fixed gaussian dictionary atom yields a high-low separation. 


Add: 

solvemdbd_cg, ism is the extension of solvemibd to incorporate a diagonal term in the solver. Useful for any term in the form of |K* x| or |K*D|.
