Experiments for learning dictionaries from different resolutions: 

varsplit_multilearn: learn same dictionary on a two-layered image pyramid constructed by gaussian blurring 	and downsampling.
 
joint_multilearn: same as varsplit_multilearn except an additional layer solely for the top layer was added.

samecoeff_multilearn: Allowing dictionaries to be different, images the same size, but forcing sparse 		coefficients to be the same.
