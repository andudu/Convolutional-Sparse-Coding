% Experiment to test the effects of Laplacian Sparse Coding on clean images

% lambda = .05 .2 .3
% numdict = 5 10 15 
% mu = .5*lambda

% results: 
% Laplacian Dictionaries tend to be more consistent, fitting all similiar
% patches instead of isolated locations. 
% This is most visible when number of dictionaries is high. 
% when sparsity lambda is low, both reduce to very short edge like filters
% and difference is minimal.
