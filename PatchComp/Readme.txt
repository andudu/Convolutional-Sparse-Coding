Experiments for comparing patch based denoising against convolutional based denoising. 


Results: 

Overfitting does occur in patch based denoising. Averaging preserves more long edges than short edges. 
This does not happen in convolutional sparse coding since spatial coefficients are jointly fitted and can cooperate to fit noise well. 

Group sparsity does not achieve any level of averaging in the reconstruction.
